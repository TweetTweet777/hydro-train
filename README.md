### How does a hydrogen powered train work? And does hydrogen power affect the atmosphere?

#### Elements of a Hydrogen powered train and how they work:
Hydrogen:
> The hydrogen or `H2` is the fuel of the train used by the fuel cell, essentially powering the train. The hydrogen is stored as a gas in tanks on the roof or on the undercarriage (bottom) of the train.

The Fuel Cell:
> The fuel cell’s primary job is to convert the hydrogen into electricity. It generates electricity via a chemical reaction. It combines `H2` with `O2` or oxygen, which is pulled from the surrounding air. When the two elements combine, they combust and produce electricity and the only exhaust (unwanted output) is Water and Steam which does not harm the environment.

Lithium-ion batteries:
> The batteries store additional energy produced in the chemical reaction, as well as kinetic energy made from the train when it’s braking. During normal operation, the batteries supply the train with power and can be used to boost the train’s acceleration.

The Auxiliary Converter:
> The auxiliary converter converts electricity from the batteries into electricity that can be used on board, eg.:
>- air conditioning, 
>- doors, 
>- passenger information, 
>- displays, 
>- lighting, etc.

The traction inverter / converter:
> It ensures that the appropriate form of energy is being used between the fuel cell, batteries and the traction motor. Also, it collects the kinetic energy from the train braking, then it redistributes the power throughout the train.

The Traction motor:
> It drives the train’s wheels and brakes.

#### Does hydrogen power affect the atmosphere?:
> According to multiple sources, hydrogen power is 100% emission free, as it’s only exhaust is water and steam - which are naturally occuring resource.  Though, that’s just from using the power, what about making it? According to Caltech, if hydrogen accumulates in the atmosphere it can cause 10% decrease in our ozone layer. Ideally, a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle has no environmental impact, but making it does.
